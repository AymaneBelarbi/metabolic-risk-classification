# Metabolic Risk Classification Using Glucose–Insulin Biomarkers

**Short summary**  
End-to-end ML project to classify metabolic states (Insulin Resistant, Beta-cell Failure, Hyperinsulinemia, etc.) using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Feature engineering focuses on clinical biomarkers (HOMA-IR, GIR), followed by modeling with scikit-learn pipelines and Random Forest.
